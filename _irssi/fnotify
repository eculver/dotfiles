josh k, thanks jason
josh how's the neck?
jason not too bad, thanks. better than yesterday for sure. helps to have this heating pad on
rzurad interesting: what does wiredrive.com look like to a colorblind person http://colorfilter.wickline.org/?a=1;r=;l=0;j=1;u=www.wiredrive.com;t=p
rzurad filter any site to see what it looks like to various kinds of color blind people http://colorfilter.wickline.org/
Kyle But what does Wiredrive.com look like to a dog ^_-
Kyle these questions, beg to be answered.
rzurad apparently colorblind people also have problems with image antialiasing :P
rzurad hmmm... must find a Toto filter...
josh Stefan: found the problem for library reel and SSL
josh just a stupid 1 line fix
josh just let me know when u want to test it
Stefan I will run to truck for Daniel and he will test
Stefan Please let him know/
Stefan He is on IM
josh eculver: is sal not in yet?
josh no worries
josh the more i read about django the more i wished we moved to it sooner
josh the orm is table gateway but has crap tons of convenience tools
josh i was going to ask you how it handles concurrency issues with save/delete
josh so if a delete is called on a model within one request and a second request calls an update, the update may put the record back?
josh yea
josh i was just curious about the hard delete case with concurrent requests
josh i guess transactions would fix that
josh u can do a select for update through the orm?
josh fancy that
josh eculver: what do you mean? it calls new recusively?
josh oh that, that's not recursive
josh it just gets handled by the garbage collector
josh if an object has no references, the php GC tosses it
josh eculver: thats only in the error case
josh it can potentially cause an out of memory exception since the stack trace gets too high
josh yeah
josh on production the problem was relayd losing the connection somewhere
josh the exception should return false and have the calling code reinitialize the manager i think
josh wait, i don't see the new call in the callback
josh oh, inside the initconsume
josh yeah..i'm not sure if that'll get GC'ed
josh since the amqp library might still hold a reference
josh yeah, u're understanding it correctly
josh its not designed well
josh haha
 
josh ah, u got to the dispatch part
josh btw does wsgi python run as a single process with multiple threads?
josh i think it's like 100/sec on average?
josh during peak hours i mean
josh i think 8 physical, each running 4 virtual
josh there might be more
josh yeah
josh probably
josh running 8 each wouldn't be too much load though
josh i think
josh fyi, if you're still sick, eat the kiwi's
josh they're high in vit C like oranges
jason josh: did Nell tell you to convince us to eat the kiwis?
josh no, i just noticed theres a bunch
jason hey guys, I just ate two kiwis and they were delicious. you should really have some as well, highly recommended
josh jason: maybe we should ask nell to cut them up and get those tiny swords so it's easier to eat
jason ooh yeah, I would totally eat the crap out of sworded kiwi spears. also that takes all the hard work out of preparing them. good plan!
josh werd
jason eculver: let me know when you've got a chunk of time and we can go over what I need to do to get the api stuff running on my instance
 
rzurad fuckyea.buffers
jason nope, blank slate'
jason eculver: what branch is Dana's stuff on?
jason eculver: seems like the users api results don't have the user ids?
jason eculver: I want to merge development, projects (which includes users) and danas stuff.  I assume I should just create a single integration branch off of development and merge the other 2 in and deal with the absurd conflict fallout yes?
jason no worries, i'm busy merging more changes. it's conflict city
jason awesome! thanks
josh rzurad: finally got the billing data parsed and converted into an insert statement
josh it's in my home directory on your box
josh dbt.sql
josh it's half a gig, 2012's billing data so far
josh tap me on the shoulder when you have a second
jason eculver: I've got a question about how to handle branching now
jason so i've merged all the projects and users stuff with development in an integration branch. I'm wondering if I should leave that branch and create yet another branch where I merge dana's backbone mvc stuff? after all that conflict resolution I feel nervous about adding expirimental backbone stuff to that branch, though maybe now is the time to start integrating that stuff?
jason Stefan: you should check this out http://sleepyti.me/
jason get your sleep cycles in order
Stefan I need to
Stefan I am all out of whack
Stefan Do you use this?
jason I have, I actually have a watch that tracks your movement via accelerometer and determines your sleep cycles and then wakes you up within the best possible window
Stefan I need that watch
rzurad eculver: Y U BRING COFFEESCRIPT IN HERE!?!?!?!?!
jason rzurad: I've got a question to run by you when you have a minute
jason rzurad: I think I've got the table, search, sort, pagination, and the 2 synced tables working now
Ahmed Hey Evan
Ahmed when using oauth to do api request how do we access the user?
Ahmed it seems that I'm getting an Anonymous user all the time
Ahmed even though I'm using my consumer key and secret
Ahmed well I set it not to do that to test and I'm still not getting the correct user
Ahmed request.user is always an Anonymous user
Ahmed anyhow, it seems that Django's default authorization might be enough for our purposes too
Ahmed yep
Ahmed just under the user resource
Ahmed well it returns the results fine
Ahmed and when I turn on debugging and check request under dispatch for example it has an Anon user
Ahmed np
Ahmed Yeah, I saw that, but I tried to turn DEBUG to False and it broke
Ahmed so I overridden the authentication and authorization in the user resource and still Anon
Ahmed anyways, it
Ahmed is not a big deal
Ahmed what's more important is how to hook up our users to the Django auth user
Ahmed yeah I did that too and same result
Ahmed I dug into Django authorization a bit and it seems to be enough for our purposes
Ahmed but the big deal is authenticating against our users
Ahmed hey
Ahmed I figured out how to add the user to the request
Ahmed yep
Ahmed I had to modify the auth/authentication.py
Ahmed just got the user_id from the cosumer, fetched the user and added the user to the request
Ahmed now I can see the user in the request from the user resource
Ahmed that'
Ahmed s nice and all, but the hard part haven't been figured out yet
Ahmed because this is still an auth_user
jason have you guys ever seen this? freaking amazing: http://amzn.to/viu8TR
jason you can plug it into your tv and it has controller inputs, so it replaces the super nintendo and doubles as a handheld! genius!
rzurad ^ that is awesome!

jason k
josh k
jason josh: Stefan: I've pushed an update to the int/embed-player.rc tag. it can go out if we like. it fixes an issue David found where when chrome prevents the quicktime plugin from loading the controls are still visible before you accept the plugin. Also improves quicktime event reporting.
Kyle look what I found in the Etsy team's graphite dashboard code lol: https://github.com/etsy/dashboard/blob/master/htdocs/images/black.jpg

Stefan A big thanks goes out to Southwest Airlines for losing my bag. Hopefully this nightmare ends soon.
rzurad :(
rzurad it took american airlines 40 minutes to get the bags off the plane and then onto the wrong carousel at LAX
josh fail
josh too much eggnog
rzurad i had 8 bottles of beer and a glass of wine in my checked bag. I was thinking the fuckers drank it.
josh i wouldn't be surprised
rzurad *bottle of wine
david i'm suspending the vms to update vmware
josh going truck today if anyone is interested
david sure I can do the truck
david I'm gonna shut down the vmware instances on the Mac Pro in the server room so I can update teh vmware
Kyle Can someone spot me $5? :[
Kyle so I can haz truck
josh yea, i can spot you
Kyle woot thanks man
Kyle btw, your car and my car are both 2013 IIHS top safety picks, woot lol
josh woo!
jason josh: I've found a bug in presentations. If I click to a 3rd or 4th page of items, then click into the detail I get an internal server error. It appears that the carousel.phtml partial is looking for asset indexes that aren't provided for some of the assets ('displayUrl' and 'assetOffset'). I can modify it to work in spite of this, but I'd imagine we'd want to make sure all the assets are passing through that information.
jason for example: http://fullsample.wiredrive.qa/present-project-detail/assetId/8239085/token/2c5ed0561c21c9f90068928f8eb62e48
josh oh, this has been fixed on dev and master
jason oh ok
jason cool, never mind then
josh not sure how you can pull in the fi
josh *fix
jason that's fine, I don't really need it to finish my stuff
josh ah ok
jason josh: I did just push a new tag though for int/embed-player fixing most of the open bugs
josh k, i'll redeploy
josh jason: did you want me to re-deploy again?

Kyle Kinda looks like http://fullsample.wiredrive.ci/ is acting weird anyways
Kyle It's trying to grab the branding resources from /wd/host/cl0/wiredrive.ci/branding/images/clients/WD-B1ZE4 instead of /wd/host/cl0/wiredrive.ci/branding/images/clients/fullsample
david I think that is in line with what I was seeing yesterday.  It was working during the earlier 1/2 of the day, then that presentation stopped working before I left.
jason josh: DanielB: rzurad: I pushed out a new tag for the fixes I've been working on to support cross-domain postMessage as well as better conforming to moogaloop so we can get that vimeo embed page working with a few tweaks to the iframe html
jason rzurad: for reference regarding postMessage https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.postMessage
DanielB do you need it deployed?
jason basically just making the second argument a "*" wildcard fixes the issue. But postMessage is what vimeo uses to communicate between the frame and page, so it doesn't support IE7 and older browsers
jason yeah, it can go out to QA and I can show you what needs to change with the iframe code whenever you want to test that vimeo embed html page you have again
DanielB int/embed-player.rc is on it's way to qa
jason thanks
rzurad jason: yeah I was looking into that after standup. soooo much better than CORS.
jason it's so easy, built right in
jason makes the code really concise, how it should be
rzurad yeah. and you don't have to do anything... anywhere, really, except the browser. so nice
david Hi Guys, what visual sql client would you recommend for osx?
Kyle They used to have really good tools directly from MySQL for OS X :\ I think they EOL'd them though :[
Kyle http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.html
Kyle Looks like this is the new one: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
Kyle Although I think that's actually windows only :\
rzurad i thought workbench was for design, rather than live querying
Kyle I think so too
Kyle Kinda misleading that on the GUI tools page they put "http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/ has replaced the GUI Tools Bundle"
rzurad lol
rzurad unless they're calling "Workbench" the package of apps that includes one for design and one for live querying
Kyle This looks dope: http://www.sequelpro.com/
Kyle and free
Kyle yeah I just downloaded that ^ it's pretty cool
Kyle Has an SSH feature, so you can go through your developer instance to access db0 and whatnot
david oracle and their signin and registration makes it feel like I'm signing over my soul to use their mysql client.
Kyle use sequelpro
Kyle tis pretty nice having only used it for 3 minutes lol
DanielB what is the cmd in python for mkdir owned by a specific user ?
Kyle How to make a dir, and specify a specific user as the owner of it? Or how to determine the owner of a dir?
DanielB david: Mysql workbench can run queries as well
DanielB I have it and it runs fine
DanielB Kyle: we need the salt module (run as root) to make a dir owned by wd
Kyle Why not do it in the states file like it's being done now?
david Can I use the same DB settings on the ops config file for connecting to the DB on QA and CI
david or are those only for localhost?  I can't seem to connect using those db strings
Kyle let me see
david any advice on db lib I should use for connecting to the db in python.
rzurad eculver: ^
DanielB Kyle: we are buiding a multi step module for deploying the code out to all the servers.   Too many vars involved for a state file
Kyle Okay why not just do os.chown after os.mkdir
david I'm thinking maybe it's better to go with an ORM in the event you switch out the DB in the future.  But it does add troubles in having to create all those object/table mappings
josh DanielB: since there are no more hotfixes, billing is back onto wiredrive.IT for farah and frank to test
DanielB ok.  thanks
DanielB josh: one problem with billing I know will come up, there are " around all the numbers in the export, so ording is done alphbetica.
josh DanielB: u'll need to convert the column to be numeric type since the quotes are standard in csv
DanielB I fixed it in the csv
DanielB it's all good
rzurad is the export route for billing done? If so, let me know because last I checked the page itself redirects you to ?routekey=bogus when you click on the export button
rzurad s/billing/usage
josh rzurad: should be just 'billing-export'
rzurad done. hooked up and the tag is updated
josh rzurad: sweet, launching now
Stefan Can you turn on 192.168.0.120?  Rob D is looking to test a few things?
david I don't know which machine that one is?  what OS/browser does it have?
david ok, that machine should be back up now
Stefan thaks
Stefan Can we also turn this machine on for Rob - 192.168.0.90
Stefan Can we also turn this machine on for Rob - 192.168.0.90
rzurad david: ^ can you do that or does somebody need to go get kyle?
david if it's on the mac pro, I can do it.
david I opened the 2 xp vms on the mac pro, neither has that ip
david I'm wondering if the ip has changed or that is some other vm image
david strange.  I have it running.. but I can't ping to it.
Stefan I think Rob is looking for Win7/IE9
Stefan oh, ok
Stefan hmmm
david the VM running win XP IE8 Ch14 seems to have that ip when I type ipconfig on that machine
david but I can't ping it using my mac
Stefan Hey guys, meeting running long.  We will have the stand-down aroun 5:50
rzurad it's all eculver's fault. everybody knows he loves long meetings
Stefan Rob is saying we have an issue with clients uploading via Windows
Stefan 
Stefan IE 9/ WIn7 combo gives Bad Server response upon upload
Stefan 
Stefan Getting the same thing on XP/ Ie8 combo
Stefan 
Stefan Trying to get more info
rzurad looking into it now on the test box with kelvin
Stefan Thanks
josh rzurad: we didn't update the jumploader
josh i don't know if the old upload url still works
rzurad it's a problem with simple uploader
rzurad it's not IE specific
rzurad I can fool chrome into thinking it doesn't have html5 upload and simple is broken
rzurad we get a 400 on simple upload file posts
rzurad I didn't change anything in simple (on purpose, that is) when we did the new upload stuff because it wasn't supposed to use the new upload stuff. only html5 was
rzurad josh: any way to see which parameter it's complaining about?
rzurad on live?
josh oh, simple is broken too?
josh let me take a look, it's probably the route
Stefan Rob said he got the error in JAVA
rzurad none of the machines near me have java installed so I didn't test it
rzurad but yeah, simple upload is broken, too
josh how do u disable the html5 uploader?
rzurad open up the page in a sane browser, and open up the app-global.js and look for isHTML5UploadAvailable
rzurad put a breakpoint where the object that contains that gets assigned to the Y.WD namespace
rzurad refresh the page
rzurad in the console say `a.isHTML5UploadAvailable = false;`
rzurad continue
josh k
rzurad and bob's your uncle
rzurad i think simple and java use the same route?
Stefan Do you guys need anything from me?  More info?  More details from Rob?
rzurad not sure. don't think so
rzurad got the error, josh
josh rzurad: pushing the fix to wiredrive.it
rzurad Invalid user requested in Wdl/Action/WdNode/Asset/UploadAction
josh bad user id parameter
rzurad cool
josh old controller was looking for 'user', we changed it to 'user id' at some point
josh thanks rich
rzurad np
rzurad and as far as I can tell, simple and java shared the same post url
rzurad also... i have no idea if this will fix java
josh i can't test java til it's on wiredrive.IT cuz I can't get the jumploader to load on my mac
rzurad k
josh java 7 is 64bit only and installing it screwed up the plugin

david on my dev vm.. if I wanted to dump some files into a folder where the apache server can serve it up.. where should I copy the files to?
david or where can I find the httpd.conf file?
josh david: we use nginx so the main config is under /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
rzurad josh: sal's coming back. hes gonna check it now
josh we have a wildcard for loading anything under /usr/<username>/projects/<wildcard>/www
david cool
josh you may need to ask scott/kelvin to show u
david cool
josh example: '/usr/david/projects/foobar/www/testfile.html' would be 'foobar.wiredrive.david/testfile.html'
david I don't see /usr/david, do I need to create this..?
david or is it just my normal  home directory, /projects/foobar/wwww
